# Twitter Sentiment Analysis using Machine Learning 🤖💬
## 📄 Overview
This project aims to analyze the sentiments behind tweets and classify them as positive, negative, or neutral using Machine Learning techniques. With the rise of social media, understanding public sentiment has become increasingly important, and this tool provides insights into how people feel about specific topics on Twitter. 🚀

Using Linear Regression, we’ve built a model that captures the sentiment behind each tweet based on its text, allowing us to analyze opinions on various subjects in real-time! 📈

## 💡 Project Features
- Sentiment Classification: Categorizes tweets into positive, negative, or neutral sentiment. 🟢🔴⚪️
- Data Collection: Utilizes the Twitter API to gather real-time tweets for analysis. 📲
- Text Preprocessing: Cleans and processes tweet data by removing stopwords, hashtags, mentions, and links. ✂️
- Linear Regression Model: A machine learning model that predicts sentiment based on features extracted from the text. 🧠
- Interactive Visualizations: Displays the distribution of sentiments through graphs and charts. 📊✨
## ⚙️ How it Works
- Collect Tweets: Use the Twitter API to fetch tweets related to a specific topic or hashtag.
- Preprocess the Data: Clean and prepare the tweet text by removing unnecessary elements like hashtags and mentions.
- Feature Extraction: Extract important features such as word frequencies and sentiment indicators.
- Model Training: Train the Linear Regression model on labeled tweet data to learn sentiment patterns.
- Prediction: Run new tweets through the trained model to predict their sentiment. 🎯
## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python 🐍
- Scikit-learn 🧠
- Pandas 🐼
- NumPy 🔢
- Matplotlib/Seaborn 📊
- Twitter API 🐦

## 🚀 How to Run the Project
